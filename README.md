# 1. Sales Data Analysis Project -
I conducted a comprehensive case study on a dataset that contained information about Sales Data using SQL and Tableau. SQL for data anlysis and power-bi for visualizations. The dataset includes three tables: orders, return and people.

## Goal - 
The goal of data analysis is to find patterns, best-selling items, and revenue indicators to help in business decision-
making.

## Problem Statement - 
1.Top 10 best-selling items

2.Total sales for every year
 
3.The total revenue generated by the company

4.Category with the most returned items

5.Country with the most orders

6.Top 10 most popular categories.

7.Category-Wise Profit

8.Top 10 Shipping Costs with the Highest Prices

9.The top 10 countries with the highest profit generated.

10.Average time between order placement and shipment

11.The average order value for new vs. returning customers.
    
12.Products with low sales performance that might need to be discontinued.
  
13.Product subcategory- wise highest profit margin.

14.The overall sales trend over time.

## Conclusion - 
After conducting thorough analysis on e-commerce dataset I have gained valuable insights into various aspects of business operations. here are the key findings and conclusion drawn from the analysis:

* by identifying the top selling items, we can focus on optimizing their marketing and inventory management to capitalize on their popularity and maximum revenue.
* understanding the sales performance over different years helps us track growth trajectory and identify any fluctuations or trends in consumer behavior.
* calculating the total revenue provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance and highlights its overall success in generating income.
* identifying the category with the highest return rate allows us to investigate the underlying reasons for return and implement measures to improve product quality or consumer satisfaction.
* knowing the country with the highest order volume helps us allocate resources effectively and tailor marketing strategies to specific geographic regions.
* recognizing the most popular categories enables us to allocate resources, prioritize product development, and tailor marketing efforts to meet consumer preferences.
* analyzing profit margins across different categories guides strategic decision-making regarding pricing and product selection.
* identifying high shipping costs allows us to optimize logistics, negotiate better shipping rates and improve cost efficiency.
* understanding the profitability of different countries helps us prioritize international markets and tailor our expansion strategies accordingly.
* monitoring the average order processing time enables us to streamline operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and meet delivery expectations.
* comparing the average order value between new and returning customers helps us assess customer loyalty and tailor marketing strategies to each segment.
* identifying products with low sales performance allows us to re-evaluate their viability, adjust pricing and marketing strategies, or consider discontinuation to optimize our product portfolio.
* understanding the profit margins at the subcategory level helps us identify high-margin products and allocate resources effectively to maximize profitability.
* analyzing the overall sales trend over time provides insights into seasonal fluctuations, market trends and the effectiveness of marketing initiatives, guiding strategic planning and decision -making processes.

Power BI Dashboard exemplifies the power of data-driven decision-making in the e-commerce domain. Through the judicious application of DAX queries and dynamic visualizations, we unearthed actionable insights that drive business growth and enhance operational efficiency.
In this Dashboard -
* Leveraged Power BI to analyze e-commerce data, employing DAX queries for in-depth insights.
* Visualized sales trends over time, product category distribution, and geographic sales patterns.
* Identified profitable products, customer segments, and shipping efficiencies through dynamic visualizations.
* Unveiled customer behavior insights and order priority dynamics to inform strategic decision-making.

In conclusion, by leveraging data analysis, we have gained valuable insights into various aspects of our e-commerce business,enabling us to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and drive sustainable growth and profitability.

# 2. Titanic Survival Prediction Project -
### Dataset description 
The Dataset contains information about the passengers on board the Titanic, including whether they survived the shipwreck or not. Here is a description of the typical fields in the Titanic Survival dataset:
1. PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
2. Survived: Survival status (0 = No; 1 = Yes).
3. Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd).
4. Name: Name of the passenger.
5. Sex: Sex of the passenger (male or female).
6. Age: Age of the passenger.
7. SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
8. Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
9. Ticket: Ticket number.
10. Fare: Passenger fare.
11. Cabin: Cabin number.
12. Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
 
### Summary
In this project, the goal was to predict whether individuals survived or not. To achieve this, I utilized a logistic regression model, which is commonly used for modeling the probability of a binary outcome based on predictor variables.

The steps involved in model training included:

Cleaning the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
Handling missing data, which involved techniques such as imputation or removal of incomplete records.
Encoding categorical features to convert them into a numerical format suitable for modeling. This step often involves techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Selecting features for testing and training data, ensuring that only relevant features were included in the model.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Training the logistic regression model on the training data.
Calculating the accuracy score to assess the model's performance on the test data.

By following these steps, I was able to develop a logistic regression model to predict survival outcomes with 78% accuracy.
